# Autofill PromptHero Uploads
This Chrome extension automatically inserts upload info saved in the PNG metadata to the [Prompthero upload](https://prompthero.com/prompt/upload). The project is not endorsed by or affiliated with PromptHero.

## Motivation
I'm a big fan of PromptHero and enjoy sharing my prompts with the community. Manually filling in the upload info is quite tedious. This Chrome extension aims to solve this inconvenience.

## Features
* Automagically fills upload info in the form after you choose a file
* Works with images generated by [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and [NMKD](https://nmkd.itch.io/t2i-gui)

## Limitations
* The model name and its version aren't saved in the PNG metadata, so those fields can't be auto-filled

## Installation
1. Download the project in GitHub via the button `Code` > `Download ZIP`
2. Unpack the ZIP file locally so you can access the files in the folder
3. Open the extension tab in Chrome: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Enable `Developer mode` with the switch in the top right corner
5. Click the `Load unpacked` button
6. Select the folder of the extension you just downloaded
