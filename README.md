## Motivation

I'm a big fan of AI art and enjoy sharing my prompts with the community. Manually filling in the upload info is quite tedious. This Chrome extension aims to solve this inconvenience.

## Features

-   Automagically fills upload info in the form after you choose a file
-   Works with images generated by [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI), and [NMKD](https://nmkd.itch.io/t2i-gui)
-   Displays a little status message in the upload forms to communicate if autofill was successful

## Limitations

-   NMKD: The model hash is not saved in the PNG metadata, so the model name and version can't be auto-filled
-   General: Only the 35 model names and versions can be auto-filled which are stored in the modelHashes.js
-   General: Inpainting overwrites the original prompt info, so the extension will autofill the inpaint prompt
